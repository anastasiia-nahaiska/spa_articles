**Explanation**

According to the requirements, (in particular `CSS preprocessors should be used`) I used
almost everywhere scss modules for styling. I think that is a good prictice to separate styling and logic.

In any case using Material UI ways for styling (such us `breakpoints properties`, `theming`, `makeStyles()`, etc) won't be a problem for me.
